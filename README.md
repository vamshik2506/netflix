# 🎬 AWS S3 Movie Management Application

## 📌 Overview
This project is a **serverless movie management application** built on AWS.  
It allows **admins** to upload videos to an Amazon S3 bucket, categorize them (Drama, Comedy, Action, etc.),  
and enables **users** to view movies filtered by category.

The entire solution is deployed using a **CloudFormation template**, making it fully automated and easily reproducible.

---

## 🛠 Features
- **Admin Panel** to:
  - Upload movies to S3
  - Assign categories to each movie
- **User Interface** to:
  - View movies by category (Drama, Comedy, Action, etc.)
  - Stream videos directly from S3
- **Backend API** using AWS Lambda + API Gateway
- **Data Storage** using DynamoDB for metadata and categories
- **Static Frontend** hosted on S3 (Public Website)
- **Automated Deployment** via CloudFormation

## 📋 Deployment Steps

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git
cd <repo-name>
````

### 2️⃣ Create an S3 Bucket for Deployment

```bash
aws s3 mb s3://my-movie-app-deployment-bucket
```

### 3️⃣ Deploy the CloudFormation Stack

```bash
aws cloudformation deploy \
  --template-file cloudformation/main.yml \
  --stack-name MovieAppStack \
  --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM
```

---

## 📜 CloudFormation Resources

The `cloudformation/main.yml` file creates:

* **S3 Buckets**

  * `movie-storage-bucket` → Stores uploaded videos
  * `frontend-hosting-bucket` → Hosts static HTML/JS site
* **DynamoDB Table**

  * Stores movie metadata (name, category, file URL)
* **Lambda Functions**

  * `UploadMovieFunction` → Handles video uploads + metadata
  * `GetMoviesByCategoryFunction` → Retrieves videos by category
* **API Gateway**

  * `/upload` (POST) → Admin upload endpoint
  * `/movies` (GET) → Get movies by category
* **IAM Roles & Policies**

  * Grants Lambda access to S3 + DynamoDB

---

## 🖥 Local Development

### Prerequisites

* AWS CLI configured
* Node.js or Python installed (depending on Lambda language)
* S3 bucket already created

### Running Locally (Lambda Functions)

```bash
cd backend/
npm install   # or pip install -r requirements.txt
sam local start-api
```

---

## 🌐 Frontend Hosting

1. Build the static site:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run build
```

2. Upload to S3:

```bash
aws s3 sync build/ s3://<frontend-hosting-bucket>
```

3. Enable public website hosting in S3 bucket settings.

---

## 🎯 Usage

* **Admin Login** → Go to `/admin.html`, upload a movie, select category.
* **User View** → Go to `/index.html`, select category (Drama, Comedy, etc.), view videos.

## 🔒 Security Notes

* Use **signed URLs** for private video access
* Restrict S3 bucket access via IAM policies
* Use AWS Cognito or IAM Authentication for admin access

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements

* Add **search functionality** for movies
* Integrate **AWS CloudFront** for faster video delivery
* Implement **user authentication** for better access control
